ReproNim is a national multi-site technology and research development center for reproducible neuroimaging computation.  ReproNim is funded by a [P41 award](https://reporter.nih.gov/project-details/8999833#description) from the [National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/). 

Our project and core teams are based at six sites: UMass Chan Medical School, MIT, Dartmouth College, McGill University, The University of California San Diego, and UC Irvine.

## What we do

ReproNim's mission is to deliver effective tools, training, and principles to the neuroimaging community to support the entire neuroimaging workflow for rigorous, reproducible, and FAIR neuroimaging.

## What we offer

ReproNim offers a variety of resources to educate and enable individual researchers, imaging centers, and students.  Our resources address both conceptual and practical fundamentals of reproducible neuroimaging, why it is important, and how to do it through principles, tools, and training.

## ReproNim/INCF Fellows
 
The [ReproNim/INCF Fellowship](/fellowship/) is a full year, project-based train-the-trainer program with access to networking and mentorship.  It supports Fellows' training program development endeavors, which are tailored to their respective target audiences, training objectives, and local environs.

[ReproNim/INCF Fellows](/fellowship/#2024-awardees) (33 graduates, and 12 current fellows) are an important extension of ReproNim, with international representation and educational reach to highly varied audiences encompassing all career stages and diverse resources. 

The program is open by competitive review to applicants at all career stages.
