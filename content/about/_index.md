## ReproNim is a National Center funded through the NIH

ReproNim is a National multi-site technology and research development Center for reproducible neuroimaging computation, funded by a P41 award from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. 
Collectively, our project and core teams are based across six sites (UMassChan Medical School, MIT, Dartmouth College, McGill, UCSD, and UCI) in North America.

## What we do

Our mission is to enhance reproducibility of neuroimaging research by developing, disseminating and spurring adoption of key concepts, practices and tools.

## What we offer

ReproNim offers a variety of resources to educate and enable individual researchers, imaging centers and students on both conceptual and practical fundamentals of  reproducible neuroimaging, why it is important and how to do it through principles, tools and training.

## ReproNim/INCF Fellows
 
The ReproNim/INCF Fellows (33 graduates, and 12 current fellows) are an important extension of ReproNim, with international representation and educational reach to highly varied audiences encompassing all career stages and diverse resources. 
The ReproNim/INCF Fellowship is a full year, project-based Train-the-Trainer program, with access to networking and mentorship in support of Fellows' training program development endeavors, which are tailored to their respective target audiences, training objectives, and local environs.
The program is open by competitive review, to applicants at all career stages.
