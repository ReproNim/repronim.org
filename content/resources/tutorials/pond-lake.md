**[Reproducible neuroimaging principles](/about/in-practice/#repronims-principles-of-reproducible-neuroimaging)**: 1b: Use pre-exising data, 2c: Annotate data.

**[Actions](/about/in-practice/#repronims-four-core-actions)**: Standards, Annotation and provenance.

**Standards**: [BIDS](/resources/tools/bids/index.html), [NIDM](/resources/tools/nidm/index.html).

**Tools**: [Neurobagel](https://neurobagel.org/), [PyNIDM](/resources/tools/pynidm/index.html), [ReproLake](/resources/tools/reprolake/).

## Challenge

While the ultimate goal of reproducible neuroimaging *within* an experiment set is to obtain and preserve *both* the data and the associated details (metadata) as an integrated data set,  the larger objective is to save and store these integrated data sets in a manner that facilitates fully FAIR data sharing *between **sites*** and **studies**.  If data are poorly annotated, if everyone uses their own naming scheme, if data are all stored in different formats and metadata are scattered across different storage devices or investigatorâ€™s private drives, it becomes very difficult to find and reuse data, whether that data is **private to the lab/project** or **publicly available**. How do the FAIR principles apply? **Findable** means that PIs and project managers, for example,  can find the data, that is, it is annotated and stored in a way that allows search across all metadata.  **Accessible** means that users can easily retrieve the relevant data once found.  **Interoperable** means that the semantics of the metadata are clear and machine-processable so that related items can easily be retrieved and interpreted. **Reusable** means that the data have enough metadata and provenance recorded that the data can be understood and reused.

## Exercise

Here we will learn how to set up a **local** FAIR metadata store, which is known as a **ReproPond** in the ReproSystem.  We will learn how to add subject-level (meta)data to the ReproPond produced by following the Implementing data management basics:  Creating a BIDS Data Dictionary tutorial and learn how to perform queries using a user-friendly user interface (**Neurobagel**). Because the data and metadata are standards compliant, using BIDS and NIDM respectively, all such ReproPonds can be cross-queried, allowing, for example, multiple sites within a project to share metadata across a set of federated local nodes. We will also show how data can be retrieved from the **ReproLake,** a semantically aligned store of publicly-available datasets from OpenNeuro and other projects developed and maintained by ReproNim. Researchers can then use the **Neurobagel Query** tool to search across both ReproPonds and the ReproLake, using criteria like age, diagnosis, and other annotated variables. The query tool allows researchers to download both **participant-level** and **dataset-level** results, facilitating the discovery and retrieval of relevant data for cross-study analysis.

## Before you start

* Raw data files need to be organized as per the **BIDS format** (see [Converting DICOM to BIDS](http://resources/tutorials/dicom-to-bids/) tutorial)
* A **data dictionary** that can be used for both BIDS and NIDM compliant representations for ReproPonds and Lake is available (see [Implementing data management basics:  Creating a BIDS Data Dictionary and Adding Semantics for FAIR](/resources/tutorials/data-dictionary/)
  * The ReproPond is built from the **nidm.ttl** file containing semantically-enhanced subject-level data
* The **Neurobagel tools** need to be installed.  To run the Neurobagel Docker, the Docker service needs to be installed on the host machine (refer [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/)).  Also ensure that there is a docker group setup and the current user is a member of the docker and root groups (as per [https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)):

```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo usermod -aG root $USER
```

* Make sure you have a working knowledge of git and git installed ([see the Git tutorial](/resources/tutorials/git/#step-1-install-the-necessary-tools) for more information).

## Step by step guide

### Step 1: Set up your local ReproPond using Neurobagel

Mount your NIDM file (nidm.ttl) containing the study data using Neurobagel to create a local ReproPond.

Install the Neurobagel Docker.  Please refer to https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/getting_started/ for full details.

Clone the Neurobagel recipes:

```
git clone https://github.com/neurobagel/recipes.git
```

Make copies of the template configuration files to edit for your deployment (do not edit the templates themselves).

```
cp template.env .env
cp local_nb_nodes.template.json local_nb_nodes.json
```

Replace the placeholder value for NB_API_QUERY_URL in the .env file (near line 65) with the address of the machine you are going to deploy Neurobagel on.

```
NB_API_QUERY_URL=[http://XX.XX.XX.XX](http://XX.XX.XX.XX)
```

If you are deploying Neurobagel for the local computer use: NB_API_QUERY_URL=http://localhost:8080 where :8080 is the default port for the federation API. Please refer to our detailed documentation for a complete overview of configuration options.

```
NB_API_QUERY_URL=localhost:8080
```

In the terminal window still in the recipes directory launch the docker by entering:

```
docker compose --profile full_stack up -d
```

Running the docker services for the first time, there should be a network interface, volume and four container services running.

![A screenshot of docker running.](/images/pond-lake-1.png)

Check that your docker containers have launched correctly by running:

```
docker ps
```

There should be four docker services running.

![A screenshot of the output of docker ps.](/images/pond-lake-2.png)

To stop the service enter:

```
docker compose --profile full_stack down
```

For full details of profiles and environmental variables at https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/config/. For additional information for maintaining a node refer to https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/maintaining/.

### Step 2: Add local data and metadata to the local node

Refer to [https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/config/](https://neurobagel.org/user_guide/config/#uploading-data-to-the-graph-store).

The neurobagel/recipes repo contains a helper script scripts/add_data_to_graph.sh for automatically uploading all JSONLD and/or TTL files (i.e., graph-ready data) in a directory to a specific graph database. Below is an example of uploading files from a neurobagel_examples directory and clearing the existing data:

```
./add_data_to_graph.sh PATH/TO/neurobagel_examples/ localhost:7200 repositories/my_db DBUSER DBPASSWORD --clear-data
```

e.g.

```
./add_data_to_graph.sh uploads/ localhost:7200 repositories/my_db DBUSER DBPASSWORD --clear-data
```

If security is not an issue, keep the username and password the same (i.e. DBUSER and DBPASSWORD). Do not change the repository name, leave as repositories/my_db.

The --clear-data flag removes any existing data in the database (if the database is empty, the flag has no effect). You can choose to omit the flag or explicitly specify --no-clear-data (default behavior) to skip this step.

### Step 3: Use Neurobagel for cross-study queries

Multiple local nodes (ReproPond) and public nodes (ReproLake).

In a web browser access your own query tool at http://localhost:3000

![The Neurobagel query GUI.](/images/pond-lake-3.png)

Select between your local, federated nodes and the ReproLake node.

![The Neurobagel GUI being used to select a data source.](/images/pond-lake-4.png)

Select other attributes for your query (e.g. age, diagnosis) and click on the Submit Query button.

Select the desired studies and click to Download Participant-Level Results and Dataset-Level Results.

### Step 4: Download new data

Create a working directory for your project and place the Participant-Level and Dataset-Level Results TSV files inside.

Open a terminal window in the working directory.

Copy and run the following command:

```
docker run -t -v $(pwd):/data neurobagel/dataget:latest /data/dataset-level-results.tsv /data/participant-level-results.tsv /data/output
```

The downloaded data will be saved in a directory called output in the current directory.
