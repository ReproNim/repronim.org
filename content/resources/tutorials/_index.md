To get started with ReproNim, we have created a set of  tutorials to show how ReproNim’s tools and services support best practices laid out in [ReproNim’s principles of Reproducible Neuroimaging](/about/in-practice/) and [ReproNim’s 4 Core Actions](/about/in-practice/).  We have organized these tutorials based on our [user personas](/resources/getting-started/) to illustrate how ReproNim’s tools can meet the needs of different types of users with different skill sets and objectives. These tutorials are designed in a modular fashion, showing how individual steps to improve reproducibility can be fit together into an [overall reproducible workflow](/about/repronim-approach/).  

Tutorials are organized into basic and more advanced approaches. Each tutorial is organized in a similar fashion,  providing a list of tools, necessary skills and system requirements, along with step by step instructions to implement and use the tools. Below we provide a list of available tutorials, organized according to [ReproNim’s principles of Reproducible Neuroimaging](/about/in-practice/):

**Principle 1:  Study Planning**

* Creating a [neuroimaging data management and sharing plan](/resources/tutorials/data-management-and-sharing/)
* Guidance on [estimating costs and required resources](/resources/estimating-cost/) for implementing reproducible practices 
* Set up a data collection and annotation framework for a multisite study using [ReproSchema](/resources/tutorials/reproschema/).

**Principle 2: Data and metadata management**

      * Actions: Standards, Annotation and Provenance, Version control 

* *Basic:*  Using ReproNim tools to [convert data to the BIDS standard](/resources/tutorials/dicom-to-bids/) and [create a data dictionary](/resources/tutorials/data-dictionary/)
* *Basic+:*  Adding standards and semantics to data dictionaries to promote data harmonization and findability
* *Advanced:* Putting your derived data into BIDS derivatives and creating a semantically-enriched  data dictionary using NIDM, a standard for annotating neuroimaging data
* *Advanced:* [DataLad containers/run \+, YODA principles](/resources/tutorials/repronim-containers/)
* *Advanced:* [Searching and sharing metadata through ReproPond and ReproLake](/resources/tutorials/pond-lake/)
  
**Principle 3: Software management**

      * Actions: Version control, Annotation, Use containers

* *Basic:*  [Using Git to manage workflow/pipeline versions](/resources/tutorials/git/)
* *Basic+:* [Curating and processing a single study to generate standardized, analysis-ready data to participate in distributed projects using *
  Nipoppy](/resources/tutorials/nipoppy/)
* *Basic+:* Working with containers:  Using Neurodocker to containerize computational
* *Advanced:* [DataLad containers/run \+, YODA principles](/resources/tutorials/repronim-containers/)

**Principle 4:  Publish everything**

* Publishing your work as a “Re-executable paper”( \= text, data, code):  Standards-based data sharing through OpenNeuro
