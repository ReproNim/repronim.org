TODO: [GH 124](https://github.com/ReproNim/repronim.org/issues/124)

To get started with ReproNim, we have created a set of  tutorials to show how ReproNim’s tools and services support best practices laid out in [ReproNim’s principles of Reproducible Neuroimaging](/about/in-practice/) and [ReproNim’s 4 Core Actions](/about/in-practice/).  We have organized these tutorials based on our [user personas](/resources/getting-started/) to illustrate how ReproNim’s tools can meet the needs of different types of users with different skill sets and objectives. These tutorials are designed in a modular fashion, showing how individual steps to improve reproducibility can be fit together into an [overall reproducible workflow](/about/repronim-approach/).  

Tutorials are organized into basic and more advanced approaches. Each tutorial is organized in a similar fashion,  providing a list of tools, necessary skills and system requirements, along with step by step instructions to implement and use the tools.
