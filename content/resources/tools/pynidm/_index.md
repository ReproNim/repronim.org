*Neuroimaging Data Model written in Python*

PyNIDM is a command line tool for working with [NIDM](../nidm/index.html) data. PyNIDM can:

- Generate NIDM data from a BIDS dataset.
- Generate NIDM from a CSV file.
- Convert NIDM data between formats.
- Merge NIDM data from multiple sources.
- Visualize NIDM data.
- Query NIDM data.

PyNIDM also provides a utility to query NIDM data using a REST API.

## Development status

PyNIDM is production software and is actively maintained.

## Innovation

PyNIDM is the first tool to allow working with NIDM without needing to understand the details of its semantics.  While NIDM itself is a complicated standard that requires precise technical knowledge and some analysis software uses NIDM completely behind the scenes, PyNIDM allows interested users and developers to work with NIDM without being an expert in the standard.
