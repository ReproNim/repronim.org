This section describes core tools and standards produced by ReproNim. Each tool page has a description of the tool, the [principles and actions](https://repronim.netlify.app/about/in-practice/) to which it applies and provides information on how to access the tool along with links to help materials, useful references and [tutorials](https://repronim.netlify.app/resources/tutorials/). 

For a general orientation to ReproNim resources, we suggest reviewing the [Getting started with ReproNim](https://repronim.netlify.app/resources/getting-started/) and [Resources](https://repronim.netlify.app/resources/) overviews.

## Core Standards

- [The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)](bids/index.html): A standard for organizing neuroimaging data and metadata on disk.
- [The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM)](nidm/index.html): A Semantic Web extension for neuroimaging concepts.

## Core Tools

- [DataLad](datalad/index.html): Software for data versioning and distribution.
- [HeuDiConv](heudiconv/index.html): A DICOM to BIDS converter.
- [Neurobagel](neurobagel/index.html): A set of tools to query and share clinical and brain imaging data.
- [Neurodocker](neurodocker/index.html): A tool to generate custom Dockerfiles and Singularity recipes to containerize neuroimaging tools.
- [Nipoppy](nipoppy/index.html): A command line tool to manage a complete neuroimaging processing workflow.
- [PyNIDM](pynidm/index.html): A command line tool for working with NIDM data.
- [ReproSchema](reproschema/index.html): A tool for defining, sharing, and reusing structured research protocols, enabling versioning and interoperability across studies.

## Infrastructure

- [ReproLake](reprolake/index.html): A public triplestore of neuroimaging metadata.

## Best Practices

- [ReproIn](reproin/index.html): Convention and helpers for naming and organization of MRI sequences for turnkey DICOM to BIDS conversion.
