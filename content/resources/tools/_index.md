This section describes core tools and standards produced by ReproNim.  For a more comprehensive catalog of resources related to reproducible neuroimaging, please see the [ReproInventory project](https://github.com/ReproNim/ReproInventory).

## Core Tools

- [DataLad](datalad/index.html): Distribution and version control system for all digital objects of science.
- [HeuDiConv](heudiconv/index.html): Converter from DICOM into BIDS.
- [Neurobagel](neurobagel/index.html): A set of tools to query and share data (clinical and brain imaging) in a fully distributed way, keeping the local governance.
- [Neurodocker](neurodocker/index.html): A tool to generate custom Dockerfiles and Singularity recipes.
- [ReproSchema](reproschema/index.html): A tool for defining, sharing, and reusing structured research protocols, enabling versioning and interoperability across studies.

## Core Standards

- [BIDS](bids/index.html)
- [NIDM](nidm/index.html)

## Best Practices

- [Nipoppy](nipoppy/index.html): A protocol and a set of tools to help standardize the processing a study that has neuroimaging data.
- [ReproIn](reproin/index.html): Best practices scripts and configuration files for DICOM to BIDS conversion.
