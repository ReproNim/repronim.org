ReproSchema is a framework for structured survey development and data collection.  It provides:

- A library of common assessments and questionnaires.
- A user interface for data collection.
- A server for backend data collection.
- A command line tool for preparing new assessments for the ReproSchema.

## Development status

ReproSchema is complete and is actively maintained.

## Innovation

ReproSchema applies reproducible neuroimaging principles to assessments, allowing behavioral and survey data to be included in ReproNim's workflows.  ReproSchema provides both the backend infrastructure to do this as well as a front end to immediately use this technology.
