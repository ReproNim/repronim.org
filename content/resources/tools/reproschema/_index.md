### Conformance statement

Reproschema fully supports the creation, sharing, and reuse of structured research protocols as described. It reliably handles schema versioning and ensures interoperability between different tools, making it suitable for various research workflows. However, users should note that advanced features, such as full integration with some external tools or platforms, may require additional customization or familiarity with JSON-LD and Git.
