*Flexible DICOM conversion into structured directory layouts.*

HeuDiConv (Heuristic DICOM Converter) enables flexible and efficient conversion of spatially reconstructed neuroimaging data from the DICOM format (quasi-ubiquitous in biomedical image acquisition systems, particularly in clinical settings) to BIDS, as well as other file layouts.

ReproIn is a set of best practices, including usable scripts and configuration files, for using HeuDiConv and DataLad to move and prepare data from a scanner to a form suitable for reproducible neuroimaging analysis.
