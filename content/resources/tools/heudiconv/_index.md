*Flexible DICOM conversion into structured directory layouts.*

HeuDiConv (Heuristic DICOM Converter) is a command line converter from DICOM to BIDS (or other structured layouts).  HeuDiConv's conversion parameters are encoded as configurable Python code ("heuristics"), enabling flexible and efficient use.

## Development status

HeuDiConv is production software and is actively maintained.

## Innovation

Conversion from DICOM to more usable formats is complicated and requires managing a lot of metadata, but some flexibility is needed to prepare the data in a form appropriate for the next steps.  HeuDiConv allows the user to efficiently manage the flexibility while hiding unneeded complexity.
