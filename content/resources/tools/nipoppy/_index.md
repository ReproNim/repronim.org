Nipoppy is a command line tool to manage a complete neuroimaging processing workflow.  Nipoppy will organize and convertraw data, process it with existing or custom pipelines, and extract derived data for further statistical modeling and analysis.

### Citation information

### Requisite knowledge to use

Command line familiarity, some python experience if one wants to extend the ecosystem to new processings.

### Requisite technical requirements

- list of subjects to be processed,
- collection of dicoms or nifti, relies on heudiconv
- depends on python and containers

### Conformance statement

Nipoppy delivers on its promise, has already been adopted by the Enigma-PD consortium, and is usable now. It is however still a new ecosystem and extending it for a pipeline that is not already available will require understanding the configuration system and to be able to interact with the python code, and in particular the Boutiques standard that specifies input and output of containers.
