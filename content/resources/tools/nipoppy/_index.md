Nipoppy extends BIDS to help students and researchers to organize the full cycle of brain imaging processings. Nipoppy is a roadmap that relies on BIDS but extends it to help researchers adopt a standard for the processings of neuroimaging and non neuroimaging data. It automatically process new data coming in and help the organization of derived data. It offers visualization tools for monitoring the processings (what has failed, what has succeeded).

### Citation information

### Requisite knowledge to use

Command line familiarity, some python experience if one wants to extend the ecosystem to new processings.

### Requisite technical requirements

- list of subjects to be processed,
- collection of dicoms or nifti, relies on heudiconv
- depends on python and containers

### Conformance statement

Nipoppy delivers on its promise, has already been adopted by the Enigma-PD consortium, and is usable now. It is however still a new ecosystem and extending it for a pipeline that is not already available will require understanding the configuration system and to be able to interact with the python code, and in particular the Boutiques standard that specifies input and output of containers.
