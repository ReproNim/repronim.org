ReproIn is a set of best practices for using HeuDiConv and DataLad to prepare raw imaging data for analysis.  ReproIn suggests ways to annotate data using a scanner console and provides usable scripts and configuration files for data preparation.

See also [HeuDiConv](../heudiconv/index.html) and [DataLad](../datalad/index.html).

## Development status

ReproIn can be used as-is and is actively maintained.

## Innovation

ReproIn is a working example of HeuDiConv and DataLad that allows users to use these tools immediately and alter the ReproIn configurations to meet their needs rather than to have to learn HeuDiConv and DataLad from the ground up.
