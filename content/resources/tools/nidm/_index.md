The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) is an extension to the W3C PROV standard for human brain imaging.  NIDM defines PROV-compatible terms for neuroimaging concepts and relationships.

### Development status

NIDM is a mature standard widely adopted by the neuroimaging community.  Working groups actively maintain and update the standard.

### Innovation

By using Semantic Web standards and technologies as its base, NIDM builds on and uses existing frameworks and tools while focusing on neuroimaging-specific concepts.  NIDM is developed by community consensus around and open standard rather than as a closed or proprietary definition.
