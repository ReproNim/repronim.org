The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) is an extension to the W3C PROV standard for human brain imaging.  NIDM defines PROV-compatible terms for neuroimaging concepts and relationships.

NIDM is not intended to be used directly by end users.  NIDM is integrated into a number of tools, and other tools are available for people who want to work with NIDM directly or integrate it into other tools.
