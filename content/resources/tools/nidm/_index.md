The Neuroimaging Data Model (NIDM) is a framework for describing neuroimaging studies to improve data sharing in neuroimaging research.  NIDM essentially provides a common language and structure for describing neuroimaging data and research processes, making it easier for researchers to share, understand, and utilize data from different sources.  NIDM is an extension to the W3C PROV standard for human brain imaging.  NIDM defines PROV-compatible terms for neuroimaging concepts and relationships. 

## Development status

NIDM is a mature standard widely adopted by the neuroimaging community.  Working groups actively maintain and update the standard.

## Innovation

By using Semantic Web standards and technologies as its base, NIDM builds on and uses existing frameworks and tools while focusing on neuroimaging-specific concepts.  NIDM is developed by community consensus around and open standard rather than as a closed or proprietary definition.
