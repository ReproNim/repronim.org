This section is dedicated to how to make use of the ReproNim ecosystem.  It includes tools, training materials, and tutorials on how to use ReproNim resources to improve the reproducibility of your neuroimaging studies.  

If you are new to the concept of ReproNim's mission to increase reproducible practices in neuroimaging, we suggest you familiarize yourself with [why neuroimaging should be reproducible](/about/why/) and [ReproNim's Principles of Reproducible Neuroimaging](/about/principles/). 

If you are unfamiliar with ReproNim and its approach, we suggest you visit [Getting started with ReproNim](/resources/getting-started/) for a general orientation to the website and a set of user stories that illustrate how ReproNim can address data and software management issues you may encounter in your current neuroimaging workflow.
