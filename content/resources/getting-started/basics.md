## ReproNIM Best Practices

1. Proper planning:
    1. See:  Reproducible Results
    1. Good science basics, how many subjects etc
    1. Pre-registration, review from statistician
1. Data and metadata management:
    1. Follow NIH Mandates [Citation needed]
    1. Use standard data formats and extend them to meet your needs.
    1. Use version control from start to finish
    1. Annotate data using standard, reproducible procedures
1. Software management:
    1. Use released versions of open source software tools.
    1. Automate the installation of your code and its dependencies
    1. Automate the execution of your data analysis
    1. Use containers where reasonable
1. Re-executable publications

## How much will it cost?

1. Direct Resource Cost: Are the infrastructure requirements currently met? (Cloud Infrastructure and Physical Hardware)
1. What tools and standards need to be adopted?
1. Do any lab members/collaborators already have experience with the new tools and standards?
1. How comfortable are the collaborators with technical fundamentals like the command line?
