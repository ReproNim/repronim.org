## Program overview

The ReproNim/INCF Fellowship Program is a full year train-the-trainer fellowship program providing conceptual and practical training in reproducible neuroimaging as well as tailored support for individual syllabus development and implementation of reproducibility training in home institutions.

The Fellowship is project-based, focusing on networking and mentorship in support of Fellows' training program development endeavors rather than specific tasks.  The program evolves for each Fellow depending upon their goals, expertise, and local environments; previous Fellows have done a wide range of training events including thematic hackathons, a semester-long course, a training program for an imaging center, and a one-day workshop on a specific topic.

Fellows are expected to develop a mechanism for training others, to share their interest and expertise in reproducibility at their respective home institutions or local scientific communities, and to participate in four one-hour teleconferences to bring Fellows and faculty together.  We also seek Fellows' feedback on and contributions to ReproNim teaching materials, which provides opportunities for Fellows (and their students) to help refine these materials.

Applicants at any career stage are encouraged to apply.  We are also committed to creating an equitable environment where diversity is welcomed and respected.

We typically award five to ten fellowships per Fellowship year, with the total number of Fellows contingent upon the availability of funds.

## Fellowship benefits
