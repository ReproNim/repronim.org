## Program Overview

This is a full year Train-the-Trainer fellowship program which provides Fellows with conceptual and practical training in reproducible neuroimaging, as well as tailored support for individual syllabus development and implementation of reproducibility training in their home institutions.

The fellowship is a project-based Train-the-Trainer program, with access to networking and mentorship in support of Fellows' training program development endeavors, rather than a lot of specific tasks. Our previous fellows have done a wide range of training events among them (for example a thematic hackathon, or a semester long course, or a training program for an imaging center, or a one-day workshop on a specific topic), so the process evolves for each fellow depending upon their goals, expertise, and local environments.

Fellows are expected to develop some mechanism for training others and sharing their interest and expertise in reproducibility at their respective home institutions/local scientific forums, and participate in our 4 one-hour teleconference calls throughout the year, to bring Fellows and Faculty together. We also seek Fellowsâ€™ feedback on and contributions to ReproNim teaching materials, which provides potential opportunities for Fellows (and their students) to help refine these materials to be maximally useful and accessible.

We encourage applicants at any career stage and are also committed to creating an equitable fellowship environment where diversity is welcomed and respected.

We typically award five to ten fellowships per fellowship year, with the total number of Fellows contingent upon availability of funds.

## ReproNim/INCF Fellowship Benefits

- Each Fellowship class has a hybrid kickoff event held in conjunction with the OHBM BrainHack, immediately preceding the annual [OHBM Conference](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3298) wherever that conference is being held on a given year. Some travel assistance may be available to the Fellows.
- Conceptual and hands-on experience in various aspects of reproducible neuroimaging, including computational technologies, pipelines/workflows, data handling and statistics.
- Ongoing Mentorship with ReproNim faculty throughout the year and as needed going forward
- Networking and Collaborative opportunities, including ReproNim faculty, Fellows, and Alumni
- Professional and Leadership skill building
